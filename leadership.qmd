## Leadership Background

During my time at UCSB, I was a UCSB [Excursion Club](https://www.excursionclubucsb.org/) staff member. The club's mission is to make the outdoors accessible to all regardless of experience level. We provide gear and beginner-level backpacking, hiking, climbing, camping, kayaking, paddle boarding and surfing trips for club members! As a staff member, I was responsible for planning trips (including meals, transportation, and other logistics) as well as ensuring member safety. I have loved watching club members fall in love with the outdoors!
