#### **Participatory Pest Scouting and Monitoring Program: Farmer Impact**

During my Agroecology Extesion Undergraduate Research Fellowship at the University of Vermont, I conducted weekly pest scouting and research at various farms as a part of the participatory scouting and monitoring program developed by local farmers and VEPART (Vermont Entomology Participatory Action Research Team). I was given the opportunity to present the impacts of the program with my team at the Entomology Society of America 2023 conference.

#### **Data Visualization: Forest Cover and Watershed Indicators**

I cleaned and wrangled EPA data to create an interactive map visualizing forest cover change across CA from 2001 to 2016. I also cleaned and wrangled data from a National Water Quality Monitoring Council data set to visualize changes in key water quality indicators in Ventura County, CA over that same time period.
