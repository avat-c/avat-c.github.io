## Welcome!

Thanks for checking out my website! I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## About Me 

I am a fourth-year student currently finishing a Bachelors of Science in Environmental Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am passionate about building sustainable food systems and am excited about the positive impacts of agroecological transitions on people and environment. Along with agriculture, I have interests in soil science, ecological restoration, entomology, and data-driven environmental policy. Outside of my academic interests, I love to hike, cook with friends, and swim in cold water!
